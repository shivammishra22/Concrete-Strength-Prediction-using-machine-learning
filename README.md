# Concrete Strength Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its mix proportions using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various ingredients such as cement, water, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, and admixtures, the model can estimate the final strength of the concrete mixture.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains concrete mix proportions along with their corresponding compressive strength values. It includes the following features:

- Cement (kg/mÂ³)

- Blast Furnace Slag (kg/mÂ³)

- Fly Ash (kg/mÂ³)

- Water (kg/mÂ³)

- Superplasticizer (kg/mÂ³)

- Coarse Aggregate (kg/mÂ³)

- Fine Aggregate (kg/mÂ³)

- Age (days)

- Compressive Strength (MPa) - Target variable
